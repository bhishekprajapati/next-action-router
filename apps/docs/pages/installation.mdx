import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## Compatibility

Current version is only tested for `nextjs v14 (app router)`. Both javascript and typescript projects written
in nextjs v14 are Compatible. Support for nextjs v13 and v15 will roll out sooner.

<Callout type="warning">
Requirements:
- Next.js ^14
- React >= 18.2.0
- TypeScript >= 5
- Zod

</Callout>

## Required dependencies

Since `next-server-action` uses zod for input validation.
So make sure to install zod in your project.

```bash
npm install zod
```

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>OR</div>

```sh
pnpm install zod
```

## Final Installation

```sh
npm install next-server-action
```

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>OR</div>

```sh
pnpm install next-server-action
```

Now, you're all set to compose actions for your project but before that
I encourage you to go though the concepts to get the working understanding
of the library abstractions.
