# Action Middlewares

Technically, All middleware types have same signature and they all serves
the same purpose. The category of middleware gets decided on how you setup the logic flow (aka. action routing chain).

You can register a action middleware function by calling `use` method on your action router
instance and providing a function that return promise of context.

**Execution Order**: Middlewares get executed in the order in which they are chained together.

There are three different category of middlewares that you can
register on a action router instance.

- <a
    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
    href="/concepts/middlewares/#global-middlewares"
  >
    Global middlewares
  </a>
- <a
    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
    href="/concepts/middlewares/#global-middlewares"
  >
    Sub-Router middlewares
  </a>
- <a
    style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}
    href="/concepts/middlewares/#global-middlewares"
  >
    Server action level middlewares
  </a>

Let's explore each of them one by one!

## Middleware function

As I mentioned it above, there's no technical difference between the middleware categories. Regardless,
what you call it under the hood they have same signature, purpose and constraints.

For type definitions <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }} href="/types">click here</a>.

Every middleware will receieve an object of type `ActionRequest` as argument containing
the `context`, `cookies` and `headers` for the running action request.

```ts
import { cookies, headers } from "next/headers";

type ActionRequest<TContext> = {
  context: TContext;
  headers: ReturnType<typeof headers>;
  cookies: ReturnType<typeof cookies>;
};

type ActionMiddleware<TContext, TReturn> = (
  request: ActionRequest<TContext>
) => Promise<TReturn>;
```

<Callout type="error">
  **Caveat**: All the chained middleware functions must need to return a context
  once they're done executing their logic. This is important and helpful to extend
  the context object as the action requests progresses from one root to the
  final action handler. Even if you're not mutating the context then just returned the
  original context.

The returned value can only be a primitive object. Like `Array`, `Map`, etc are not allowed.

</Callout>

The returned value from a middleware will serve as context for the next chained middleware.

**Default context:** `{ inputs: null }`

## Global Middlewares

In short, The middlewares registered at the very root of the router instance are called as
global Middlewares and they will run for every single action request hitting the same router instance.

> **UseCase**: Request logging, rate limiting, auth check, etc

```ts
// lib/action.router.ts
import { ActionRouter } from "next-server-action/server";

export const rootRouter = new ActionRouter({
  // router config
})
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 3");
    return context;
  });
```

## Sub-Router middlewares

Now let's say you have two different resources in your application like **blogs** and **products**.
You want to run some specific code for all the blogs related server actions but not for products related server actions,
we can call that specific code as sub action router level middleware.

We need two more sub action routers for blog and product server actions.
Creating a sub-router is as simple as re-assigning the current action router
instance to a new variable. For mental model, you can think of it as a tree starting
from root and then branching off in different directions as needed.
I call this as **branching the action router**. Anyways, you get the point!

```ts
// lib/action.router.ts
import { ActionRouter } from "next-server-action/server";

export const router = new ActionRouter({
  // router config
})
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 3");
    return context;
  });

// branching off from root router
export const blogsRouter = rootRouter
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 3");
    return context;
  });

// branching off from root router
const productsRouter = router
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 3");
    return context;
  });
```

If a action request hits this action router.
Then here's the **execution order output**

- Global middleware 1
- Global middleware 2
- Global middleware 3

## Server action level middlewares

To be honest, in most cases this might be an over kill but can be helpful
in situations like where you want to reuse the existing action middleware. That's all!

Unlike the root/global middlewares, the middlewares which are registered very close
the to final action handler can be called as method/server action level middleware.

Example: for your blogs resource, you are implementing a `deleteBlog` method and you want
run a middleware that check if the caller have right permission to delete the requested blog.

```ts
// app/actions/index.ts
"use server";

import { blogsRouter, productsRouter } from "@/lib/action.router.ts";

export const deleteBlog = blogsRouter
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    // ... some code to check if caller is allowed
    console.log("Delete blog server action middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .run(async () => {
    // final action handler
  });

export const deleteProduct = productRouter
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    // similarly, you can register any middleware here
    // which only run for this server action method.
    console.log("Delete product server action middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .run(async () => {
    // final action handler
  });
```

Nothing to worry about, `run` method we'll cover this method soon.

## Final Execution Order

If client invokes `deleteBlog` server action. The following will be order:

- Global middleware 1
- Global middleware 2
- Global middleware 3
- Blog middleware 1
- Blog middleware 2
- Blog middleware 3
- Delete blog server action middleware 1

If client invokes `deleteProduct` server action. The following will be order:

- Global middleware 1
- Global middleware 2
- Global middleware 3
- Product middleware 1
- Product middleware 2
- Product middleware 3
- Delete product server action middleware 1
