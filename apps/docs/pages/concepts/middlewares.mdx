# Action Middlewares

You can register a action middleware function by calling `use` method on your action router
instance and providing a function that return promise of context.

Technically, All middleware types have same function signature and they all serves
the same purpose. You can categorize a middleware based on where you are registering it
in the chain/action routing tree.

**Execution Order**: Middlewares get executed in the order in which they are chained together.

Middlewares can be categorized in three different levels:

- Global level middlewares
- Sub-Router level middlewares
- Server action level middlewares

Let's explore each of them one by one!

## Middleware function

As I mentioned it above, there's no technical difference between the middleware categories. Regardless,
what you call it under the hood they have same signature, purpose and constraints.

Every middleware will receieve an object of type `ActionRequest` as an argument.

**Type Definition:**

```ts
import { cookies, headers } from "next/headers";

type ActionRequest<TContext> = {
  context: TContext;
  headers: ReturnType<typeof headers>;
  cookies: ReturnType<typeof cookies>;
};

type ActionMiddleware<TContext, TReturn> = (
  request: ActionRequest<TContext>
) => Promise<TReturn>;
```

**Base context:** `{ inputs: void }` (Initial value)

**Context**: It's just a plain old javaScript object
(aka <Link type="external"  href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52453407/the-difference-between-object-and-plain-object-in-javascript" target="\_blank">POJO</Link>).
Intially having only "inputs" as a key. We'll talk about this in detail in upcoming pages.

**‚ö†Ô∏è important**: For now the only thing that you need to know is that **always return a pojo**
from your middleware function. It's recommended that you just either return
the same context as it is or extend it by adding few more properties on it before returning it.
The returned value from a middleware will serve as new context for the next middleware in chain.

```ts
// --snip--
.use(async(request) => {
  console.log(request.context);
  console.log(request.cookies);
  console.log(request.headers);
  // if you haven't extended the original context
  // then just simply return the original one
  return request.context;
});
```

.use(async(request) => {
  console.log(request.context);
  console.log(request.cookies);
  console.log(request.headers);
  // if you want to add (extend) new properties to the context then
  return {
    ...request.context,
    "new-prop": "some-value", // <- You keep something as simple as string or any complex object.
  };
});
```

## Middleware levels

In short, The middlewares registered at the very root of the router instance are called as
global Middlewares and they will run for every single action request hitting the same router instance.

> **UseCase**: Request logging, rate limiting, auth check, etc

```ts copy
// lib/action.router.ts
import { ActionRouter } from "next-action-router/server";

export const rootRouter = new ActionRouter({
  // router config
})
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 3");
    return context;
  });
```

**Middleware execution order:**

Global middleware 1<br/>
Global middleware 2<br/>
Global middleware 3<br/>

Now let's say you have two different resources in your application like **blogs** and **products**.
You want to run some specific code for all the blogs related server actions but not for products related server actions,
we can call that specific code as sub action router level middleware.

We need two more sub action routers for blog and product server actions.
Creating a sub-action router (aka branched action router) is as simple as calling `branch` method
and re-assigning the returned action router instance to a new variable.

For mental model, you can think of it as a <Link href="/concepts#how-action-routing-works">tree starting
from root and then branching off in different directions as needed.</Link>
I call this as **branching the action router**. Anyways, you get the point!

```ts
// lib/action.router.ts
import { ActionRouter } from "next-action-router/server";

export const router = new ActionRouter({
  // router config
})
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Global middleware 3");
    return context;
  });

// branching off from root router
export const blogsRouter = rootRouter
  .branch() // <- creates a sub-router/branched router
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Blog middleware 3");
    return context;
  });

// branching off from root router
const productsRouter = router
  .branch() // <- creates a sub-router/branched router
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 2");
    return context;
  })
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log("Product middleware 3");
    return context;
  });
```

Middleware execution order for **blogs router branch:**

Global middleware 1<br/>
Global middleware 2<br/>
Global middleware 3<br/>
Blog middleware 1<br/>
Blog middleware 2<br/>
Blog middleware 3<br/>

Middleware execution order for **products router branch:**

Global middleware 1<br/>
Global middleware 2<br/>
Global middleware 3<br/>
Product middleware 1<br/>
Product middleware 2<br/>
Product middleware 3<br/>

To be honest, in most cases this might be an over kill but can be helpful
in situations like where you want to reuse the existing action middleware. That's all!

Unlike the other middlewares types, the server action level middlewares are registered in the final branch.

Example: for your blogs resource, you are implementing a `deleteBlog` method and you want
run a middleware that check if the caller have right permission to delete the requested blog.

```ts
// app/actions/index.ts
"use server";

import { blogsRouter, productsRouter } from "@/lib/action.router.ts";

/*
 * These server action methods are ready to export after
 * after creating the final branch and registering the action handler.
 */

export const deleteBlog = blogsRouter
  .branch() // <- creating final branch
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    // ... some code to check if caller is allowed
    console.log("Delete blog server action middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .run(async () => {
    // final action handler
  });

export const deleteProduct = productRouter
  .branch() // <- creating final branch
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    // similarly, you can register any middleware here
    // which only run for this server action method.
    console.log("Delete product server action middleware 1");
    return context;
  })
  .run(async () => {
    // final action handler
  });
```

Nothing to worry about, `run` method we'll cover this method soon.

If client invokes `deleteBlog` server action. The following will be order:

Global middleware 1<br />
Global middleware 2<br />
Global middleware 3<br />
Blog middleware 1<br />
Blog middleware 2<br />
Blog middleware 3<br />
Delete blog server action middleware 1

If client invokes `deleteProduct` server action. The following will be order:

Global middleware 1<br />
Global middleware 2<br />
Global middleware 3<br />
Product middleware 1<br />
Product middleware 2<br />
Product middleware 3<br />
Delete product server action middleware 1
