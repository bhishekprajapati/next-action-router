  📝 **NOTE:** If you're already familiar with the routing and middleware
  patterns, feel free to skip this page and start from
  <a
    style={{ display: "inline", textDecoration: "underline" }}
    href="/concepts/action-routing"
  >
    <span>here</span>
  </a>
</Callout>

If you're looking for compatibility and installation guide then head over to
**<a style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }} href="/installation">here</a>**

Go through the concepts page by page in order and top to bottom on each page
to get good understanding of the concepts. Skip only when you already know the concept.
This won't take you long. If you've already user nextjs server actions and have some understanding
of express like routing and middleware pattern then this shouldn't take you more than
10-15 mins.

## File Conventions

All the code examples in this documentation use **nextjs v14 `app` router
without src directory**. You're absolutely free to use `src` directory or
even organize your files as you see fit.

## How action routing works?

The basic idea behind action routing is simple. The action router
lets you define a request-response lifecycle for any action request.
You can choose to create a single action router per project or create
multiple incrementally as needed.
