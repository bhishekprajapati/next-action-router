# Action Router

`ActionRouter` is the main component behind all this magic ‚ú®. This creates
an entry point for the associated action request. In simple words, the server actions
which are defined on a particular `instance` of `ActionRouter` will start their execution
journey from that router instance.

## Quick initalization

```ts
// lib/action.router.ts

import { ActionRouter } from "next-server-action/server";

// let's call this as root router
export const rootRouter = new ActionRouter();
```

This is enough to get you started with the action routing
but there's a slightly better way to initalize the router instance
if you want to have type inference for error codes in your react client
components. Don't worry
if didn't get the point, you'll get it just keep reading.

## Better Initalization (optional)

```ts
// lib/action.router.ts

import { ActionRouter } from "next-server-action/server";

// let's call this as root router
export const rootRouter = new ActionRouter({
  error: {
    // predefined error codes at router instance level
    codes: {
      unauthorized: "You are unauthorized",
      "not-found": "Requested resource not found",
      "rate-limit-exceeded":
        "Rate limit exceeded. please try again after some time",
    },
  },
});
```

While initalizing router instance, you can define all the error codes
which can be used to return descriptive error messages to the client and
cool thing about this is error codes are inferred everywhere even
on the react components. This is really helpfull to write more robust
components and enhance user experience. This is really cool, I just love ‚ù§Ô∏è it!
