# Input Validation

So now that we have created our **exportable server actions** but how to
get user input and validate it?

For this you gonna need a zod schema for the required inputs by the final branch. Back in our
final branch, call `input` method and provide a zod schema.
The inputs will be validated internally and validated inputs will be included in context as `context.inputs = <validated-inputs>`.

```ts
// app/actions/index.ts
"use server";

import { blogsRouter } from "@/lib/action.router.ts";

const deleteBlogSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
});

export const deleteBlog = blogsRouter
  .branch()
  .input(deleteBlogSchema)
  .use(async ({ context }) => {
    // ✨ context.inputs: { id: string }
    const blog = await callToDatabse(context.inputs.id);
    // extending the context
    return {
      blog: blog,
      ...context,
    };
  })
  .run(async () => {
    // final action handler
  });
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're expecting inputs from the user then you must call the `input` method
  only in the final branch where you're creating an exportable server action.
  Because of the limitation of the current implementation, this is not enforced
  neither on type level nor on runtime level. You manually have to make sure of
  that.
