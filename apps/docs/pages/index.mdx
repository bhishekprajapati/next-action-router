# A little background

I've had experience building with `Strapi` and `Express.js`,
and what I really loved about both projects is their routing
and middleware systems.

These patterns offer several benefits, including:

- Enhanced code readability
- Increased modularity
- Cleaner API syntax
- More robust implementations
- Maximum code reusability

With the introduction of `server actions` in `Next.js`,
writing APIs has become much easier.
However, the advanced routing and middleware patterns
I valued in Strapi and Express.js are still not natively supported by Next.js.

A few months ago, when I started building a full-stack e-commerce website,
I quickly realized the need for these abstractions.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any simple and useful solutions.
So, I created a bare minimum implementation of this library for my project.
Drawing on the lessons and ideas from that draft implementation,
I developed this library with more advanced, type-safe features.

I've got more ideas but for now let's get started!

## Aim

> This library aims to simplify working with nextjs server actions. One can easily
> compose complex server actions using the provided abstractions.

## Features

- ✅ Action Routing
- ✅ Error Code management
- ✅ Error Handling
- ✅ Input Validation
- ✅ Light weight
- ✅ Middleware Support
- ✅ Snappy DX (Everything is inferred)
- ✅ Supports both js/ts projects
- ✅ Type Safety
